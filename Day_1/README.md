# ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Introduction to VLSI & Design Flow

## âœ… Topics Covered
- What is **VLSI** and why is it important?
- Applications of **VLSI in real-world devices**.
- Understanding the **VLSI Design Flow**.
- Documenting my progress using **GitHub**.

## ðŸ“– What is VLSI?
**VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration)** is a method of designing integrated circuits by combining **millions of transistors** into a single chip. It powers devices like **smartphones, laptops, and embedded systems**.

### ðŸ’¡ Real-World Applications
- **Processors (Intel, AMD, Apple M1)**
- **IoT Devices (Low-power chips)**
- **Space Tech (Radar & Navigation Systems)**

## ðŸ“œ VLSI Design Flow
This is the **step-by-step process** of designing a chip.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Steps
1. **Specification** â†’ Define chip functionality.
2. **RTL Design (Verilog)** â†’ Write hardware description.
3. **Functional Verification** â†’ Simulate & debug code.
4. **Synthesis** â†’ Convert Verilog into logic gates.
5. **Floorplanning & Placement** â†’ Arrange logic blocks.
6. **Routing** â†’ Connect components with metal layers.
7. **Fabrication** â†’ Manufacturing the chip.
8. **Testing** â†’ Validate the final design.
